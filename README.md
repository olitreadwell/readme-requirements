## What is a README?

A README is a file that contains information about a project. It is usually the first file that a user will see when they visit a project's repository. READMEs are written in Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write.

## Why is a README Important?

A README is important because it provides information about a project. It is a great way to introduce a project to a user and to provide them with information about how to use the project. A README can also be used to provide information about how to contribute to a project.
